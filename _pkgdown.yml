    data. 'fitzRoy' provides a range of functions for accessing publicly available data 
    from 'AFL Tables' <https://afltables.com>, 'Footy Wire' <https://www.footywire.com> and
    'The Squiggle' <https://squiggle.com.au>. Further functions allow for easy processing,

  - title: Experimental
    desc: >
      Experimental functions are a testing ground for new approaches that we
      believe to be worthy of greater exposure. There is no guarantee that these
      functions will stay around in the future, so please reach out if you find
      them useful.

  - title: Superseded
    desc: >
      Superseded functions have been replaced by new approaches that we believe
      to be superior, but we don't want to force you to change until you're
      ready, so the existing functions will stay around for several years.
